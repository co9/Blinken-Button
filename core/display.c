 *  The display is a pretty simple module. It consists of a timer (Timer 0)
 *  which goes through the rows 0 to 7 and sets the ports to the corresponding
 *  values to light the correct LEDs.
 *  The values are stored directly as values used to apply to the ports.
 *  The display has two buffers to store the output values. One buffer that is
 *  currently displayed and one buffer where the next image can be stored.
 *  While loading a sprite from an 8 byte array (each byte representing a row)
 *  it gets converted to the port values to ensure a fast computation.
