    Blinken Button SPI
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Adds SPI support to the Blinken Button by Interactive Matter[1].
    This allows the 8x8 LED display to be controlled by another MCU.
    
    The Blinken Button receives frames from an SPI master, which are shown
    on the display. A frame consists of 8 bytes, each of which represents
    rows 0 to 7.
