 *
 * Blinken Buttons for Beginners is an implementation of a animated
 * 8x8 Led Matrix. It is capable of displaying animations and text messages.
 * The images for the animations, the sequences of images building the
 * animations, the texts to display and the font to render the texts to images
 * is stored in the flash memory.
 *
 * The wohle program is cotrolled using timers:
 * - Timer 0 is responsible for painting the images on the display Ð hence it
 *   is called the 'Display Timer'. The timer controls the rendering of the
 *   single rows of the display. It cycles thorugh row 0 to 7, switches the
 *   row on and enables the correct Leds. By cycling thrugh this sequence really
 *   fast the human eye assembles all those rows to a complete image
 * - Timer 2 is responsible for building animations from single images.
 *   It controls the timing when the displayed image is switched and when a new
 *   image needs to be loaded.
 *
 * The main loop is implemented using so called states. Since the main loop is completely
 * controlled  by Timer 2 it has a 'state' which is activated when a new image is displayed
 * an the net animation needs to be loaded.
 * Therfore you will only find the cryptic 'process_state' in the main reoutine.
